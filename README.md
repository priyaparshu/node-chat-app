# node-chat-app
An app using socket.io
Websocket and socket.io enables two way communication between the client and the server. The client could be a web app, iphone app or an Android app. In real time we will be able to send event and event data to from server to the client which we could never do with an http API.
In this application, the client will be a web application. We will be connecting the two to allow flow of data from browser to the server or from server to the browser instantly.
